# Build Directory

This directory contains build-related files for the Electron application.

## Icon Files

For Windows builds, you should place an icon file named `icon.ico` in this directory. 
This icon will be used for the application executable and installer.

You can create an ICO file from a PNG image using online converters or image editing software.
